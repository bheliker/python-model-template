# This Dockerfile is used to build a container image that contains everything
# necessary to run the model application.
#
# It must define a `CMD` that starts the application server on the port
# specified by the `PSC_MODEL_PORT` environment variable.
#
# Other than for simple CPU-only models, this file will likely need to be updated
# to support different model requirements.
